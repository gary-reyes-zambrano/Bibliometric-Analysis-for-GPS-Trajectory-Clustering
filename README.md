# Bibliometric Analysis for GPS Trajectory Clustering

## Article title:

Scientific Production on GPS Trajectory Clustering: A Bibliometric Analysis

## Abstract:

Clustering algorithms or methods for GPS trajectories are in constant evolution due to the interest aroused in part of the scientific community. 
With the development of clustering algorithms considered traditional, improvements to these algorithms and even unique methods considered as ''novelty'' for science have emerged. 
This work aims to analyze the scientific production that exists around the topic ``GPS trajectories clustering'' by means of bibliometrics. 
Therefore, a total of 559 articles from the main collection of Scopus were analyzed, previously filtering the generated sample to discard any article that does not have a direct relationship with the topic to be analyzed. 
This analysis establishes an ideal environment for other disciplines and researchers, since it provides a current state of the trend of the subject of study in their field of research.

## Requirements

1. Installation of R ([The R project](https://www.r-project.org/))
2. Bibliometrix package
- For install use the command `install.packages("bibliometrix")`
3. Vosviewer executable ([VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/))

## Used data

Exported data from Scopus  [scopus.3-2002-2023.csv](https://github.com/gary-reyes-zambrano/Bibliometric-Analysis-for-GPS-Trajectory-Clustering/blob/main/Scopus_Export_2002-2023_(Extracted%20on%2025-jan-2024).csv)

## Extraction process
